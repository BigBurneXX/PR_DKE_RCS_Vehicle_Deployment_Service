  <h2>About Our Application</h2>
  <p>Welcome to our Vehicle Deployment Planning application!</p>
  <p>Our application is designed to streamline the process of vehicle deployment and route optimization for transportation services.
    Whether you're a driver responsible for planning vehicle routes or managing transportation logistics for your company,
    our platform provides powerful tools to efficiently manage and execute your transport operations.</p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <p>1. <strong>Vehicle Deployment Planning:</strong>
    As a driver, you can easily create and manage vehicle deployment plans within the system. Utilizing data from our integrated databases,
    you can access lists of passengers to be transported and available vehicles from your company's transport service provider.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Optimized Route Planning:</strong> Our application employs advanced algorithms to calculate the most efficient routes for vehicles,
    ensuring that all passengers are picked up from their start addresses and safely transported to their destinations.
    This includes consideration for passengers with special needs, such as wheelchair users.</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Interactive Mapping:</strong> Visualize the calculated routes on an interactive map,
    providing you with a clear overview of the planned journey and enabling you to make informed decisions regarding route adjustments and optimizations.</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Driver Log Creation:</strong> Easily generate driver logs directly from the vehicle deployment plans.
    These logs list the addresses or coordinates to be visited in sequential order,
    allowing drivers to mark each stop as visited or skipped based on real-time conditions.</p>

  <h3>How It Works:</h3>
  <p>1. <strong>Create a Deployment Plan:</strong> Input the necessary information, such as passenger lists and available vehicles,
    to create a deployment plan tailored to your transportation needs.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Optimize Routes:</strong> Our system automatically calculates the most efficient routes for your vehicles,
    taking into account all relevant factors, including passenger locations and any special requirements.</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Execute and Monitor:</strong> Once the routes are planned,
    drivers can execute the transport operations while monitoring progress in real-time.
    Any deviations or updates can be easily accommodated within the system.</p>
